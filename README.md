# EDA Sales Analysis
## Overview
The EDA Sales Analysis project explores sales data using exploratory data analysis (EDA) techniques to uncover patterns, trends, and insights that can drive business decisions. The analysis focuses on various aspects of sales performance, including product sales, regional sales distribution, seasonal trends, and customer behavior.

## Objectives
1.Perform data cleaning and preprocessing on sales data.
2.Identify missing values and handle them appropriately.
3.Visualize key sales metrics using plots and charts.
4.Discover relationships between different variables (e.g., sales, region, product category).
5.Gain insights that can inform marketing, inventory, and sales strategies.

## Features
1.Data Preprocessing: Clean and transform raw data, handle missing values, and outliers.
2.Descriptive Statistics: Calculate and summarize key metrics (mean, median, mode, etc.).
3.Data Visualization: Use various visualization tools (e.g., bar charts, histograms, box plots) to reveal insights.
4.Correlation Analysis: Explore relationships between sales and other variables.
5.Trends and Patterns: Identify seasonal sales patterns and high-performing products.

## Technologies Used
Python: The main programming language used for analysis.
Pandas: For data manipulation and cleaning.
Matplotlib: For data visualization and plotting.
Seaborn: For advanced data visualization.
NumPy: For numerical operations and handling arrays.
